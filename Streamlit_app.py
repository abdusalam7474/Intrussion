    """
    This app helps you detect potential intrusions in your IoT network by analyzing sensor data from your devices. It utilizes a machine learning model to classify various sensor readings as normal or indicative of an intrusion attempt.

    **Key Features:**

    * User-friendly interface with clear instructions.
    * Eight drop-down menus for easy data input.
    * Real-time prediction display, including a comprehensive DataFrame and a clear text representation of the predicted category.
    * (Optional) Sidebar for additional settings (model selection, data preprocessing, etc.).

    **How to Use:**

    1. Select the current readings for each sensor from the corresponding drop-down menus.
    2. Click the "Predict" button.
    3. The app will display the predicted category ("Normal" or "Intrusion") and the provided sensor readings in a DataFrame.

    **Disclaimer:** This app is for demonstration purposes only. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the underlying machine learning model and sensor data. For real-world security applications, consult with security professionals.

I want you to create a streamlit app for iot intrusion detection, the app has several sections, the first section gives an overview of what’s the app does, the second section provides an overview on how to use the app The next section contains 8 drop-down inputs .the next section is for displaying the results of the prediction of the machine learning model the section displays a dataframe which is  the set of inputs inputed by the users and a text representing predicted category. The app has a sidebar
I want to create a streamlit app the app has several sections, the first section gives an overview of what’s the app does, the second section provides an overview on what pneumonia is and display a picture of two lungs, one infected with pneumonia and another not infected with pneumonia. The next section contains a portion that allows a user to upload an image and predicts if the image is pneumonia image or not. the next section is for displaying the results of the prediction of the machine learning model the section displays the image sent by the user and another image which is a segmented form of the original image and a text which represents the category of the image predicted.
